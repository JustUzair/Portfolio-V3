      "Published step-by-step tutorials integrating different protocols and products into BuildBear such as Batua, Chainlink, and PancakeSwap using BuildBear.",
      "Worked cross-functionally with product, frontend, backend, and infrastructure teams to test upcoming features, uncover edge-case failures, and deliver detailed feedback based on black-box testing strategies.",
      "Helped unblock protocol teams lacking testnet infrastructure by showcasing how BuildBear enables testing of bridge/swap logic even where native testnets for Across or LI.FI are unavailable; this drove early adoption, with both plugins receiving 50+ plugin access requests each within the first month after announcement.",
